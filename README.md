# Practical-C
This repository is an attempt to get a better in-depth understanding of the C programming language. This is a learning journey and it is not intended as a production project.


Here's a detailed roadmap for mastering Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA), leveraging your knowledge of C. This roadmap is structured to help you build a deep understanding of algorithms, their implementation, and problem-solving skills.

### Phase 1: Fundamentals
1. **Review Basic Programming Concepts (1 week)**
   - Pointers, memory management (malloc, free)
   - Recursion
   - Time and space complexity analysis (Big O notation)

2. **Introduction to Data Structures (2 weeks)**
   - **Arrays and Strings**: Basics, multi-dimensional arrays, manipulation of strings.
   - **Linked Lists**: Singly, doubly, and circular linked lists. Implementation and manipulation.
   - **Stacks and Queues**: LIFO and FIFO principles, array-based and linked list-based implementations.

### Phase 2: Core Data Structures
3. **Trees and Graphs (4 weeks)**
   - **Trees**: Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees, AVL Trees, Heap Trees. Implement basic operations (insert, delete, traverse).
   - **Graphs**: Representation (Adjacency Matrix/List), Depth-First Search (DFS), Breadth-First Search (BFS).
   - **Advanced Trees**: B-Trees, Red-Black Trees, Trie.

4. **Hashing (2 weeks)**
   - **Hash Tables**: Implementation using arrays, collision handling (chaining, open addressing).
   - **Hash Functions**: Designing effective hash functions, understanding the load factor.

### Phase 3: Advanced Algorithms
5. **Sorting and Searching (3 weeks)**
   - **Sorting Algorithms**: Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort, Heap Sort, Radix Sort. Analyze time and space complexity.
   - **Searching Algorithms**: Binary Search, Linear Search, Ternary Search.

6. **Dynamic Programming (4 weeks)**
   - **Introduction to DP**: Understanding memoization and tabulation.
   - **Common DP Problems**: Fibonacci sequence, Knapsack problem, Longest Common Subsequence, Coin Change problem.

7. **Greedy Algorithms (2 weeks)**
   - **Concepts**: Characteristics of greedy algorithms, when they can be applied.
   - **Common Greedy Algorithms**: Huffman Coding, Kruskal’s Algorithm, Prim’s Algorithm.

### Phase 4: Problem-Solving Practice
8. **Practice Common Problems (6 weeks)**
   - **Online Judges**: Solve problems on platforms like LeetCode, Codeforces, or HackerRank.
   - **Topics to Focus**: Backtracking, bit manipulation, sliding window techniques, two-pointer approaches.

9. **Competitive Programming (Optional, 6-12 months)**
   - Participate in online contests.
   - Learn advanced techniques like segment trees, Fenwick trees, Disjoint Set Union (DSU).

### Phase 5: System Design (Optional)
10. **Introduction to System Design (4 weeks)**
    - **Concepts**: Scalability, latency, throughput, consistency.
    - **Design Patterns**: Singleton, Factory, Observer.
    - **Designing Large Systems**: Load balancing, caching, database sharding.

### Resources
- **Books**: "Introduction to Algorithms" by Cormen, "The Algorithm Design Manual" by Skiena.
- **Courses**: "Algorithms, Part I and II" on Coursera by Princeton University, MIT's OpenCourseWare on DSA.
- **Online Judges**: LeetCode, Codeforces, GeeksforGeeks.

### Tips for Success
- **Consistent Practice**: Dedicate at least 1-2 hours daily to coding problems.
- **Understand Before Coding**: Spend time understanding the problem and the underlying algorithm before implementing it.
- **Analyze and Optimize**: After solving a problem, always review the solution to see if it can be optimized.

By following this roadmap, you'll build a solid foundation in data structures and algorithms, enabling you to solve complex problems efficiently.
